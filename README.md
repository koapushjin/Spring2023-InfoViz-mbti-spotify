# When MBTI Meets Spotify

This repository presents the course project for DATS-SHU 235 Information Visualization (Spring 2023), mainly using JavaScript, D3, React and Python.

In this project, we propose a visualization system that organically shows the musical preferences of different MBTI types (dataset: [Country Wise MBTI Personality](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rajjain/country-wise-mbti-personality))for both explanatory purposes and recommendations. Our system juxtaposes musical features of playlists created for different MBTI types, as well as gives an overview of type distribution with regard to regions (dataset: [Spotify MBTI Playlists](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xtrnglc/spotify-mbti-playlists)).
